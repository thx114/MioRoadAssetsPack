# Mio Road Assets Pack
Add many road assets, including roads with service lanes.

### Warning:
Road assets are **highly experimental**. Please back up your save file before use. Known issues include:
- Once your save uses these roads, **removing the mod** may cause white textures, crashes, or game exits.
- If you **subscribe to the assets and then unsubscribe** (including the pre-installed Asset Importer [Beta]), it may result in errors and missing models.
- Subscribing to assets **without the complete loading of assets** (not restarted twice) may lead to errors and missing models.
- If your **mods fail to load successfully** while subscribing to assets, it may result in errors/missing models.
- If this mod's **sorting is before Asset Importer**, it could lead to errors or duplicate asset loading.
- There might be compatibility issues with **Configurable Elevated Road**.

Currently, these issues are related to old road assets or the Asset Importer. The assets themselves are stable.
If you want to completely remove assets, you need to go to Settings > Asset Importer > DELETE ALL IMPORTED ASSETS button to remove all assets.
