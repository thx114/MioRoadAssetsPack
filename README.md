# Mio Road Assets Pack
Add many road assets, including roads with service lanes.

### Warning:
Road assets are highly experimental. Please back up your save file before use. Known issues include:
- Once your save uses these roads, removing the mod may cause white textures, crashes, or game exits.
- If you subscribe to the assets and then unsubscribe (including the pre-installed Asset Importer [Beta]), it may result in errors and missing models.
- Subscribing to assets without the complete loading of assets (not restarted twice) may lead to errors and missing models.
- If your mods fail to load successfully while subscribing to assets, it may result in errors/missing models.

Currently, these issues are related to old road assets or the Asset Importer. The assets themselves are stable.
If you want to completely remove assets, you need to go to Settings > Asset Importer > DELETE ALL IMPORTED ASSETS button to remove all assets.
