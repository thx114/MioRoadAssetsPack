### Warning:
Road assets are **highly experimental**. Please back up your save file before use. Known issues include:
- Once your save uses these roads, **removing the mod** may cause white textures, crashes, or game exits.
- Subscribing to assets **without the complete loading of assets** (not restarted twice) may lead to errors and missing models.
- If your **mods fail to load successfully** while subscribing to assets, it may result in errors/missing models.
- Sometimes, there's a slight chance of the CID file missing during asset download/update. You'll need to **delete and reinstall** this mod.
